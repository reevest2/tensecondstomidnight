# Created for Ludum Dare 51 Compo. Rules:
The Compo
The Compo is Classic Ludum Dare. Another way to think of it is as Ludum Dare “Hard Mode”. Compo games are created entirely from scratch by one person, in just 48 hours. This is the ultimate test of your game creation skills.

You must work alone (solo).
Your game, all your content (i.e. Art, Music, Sound, etc) must be created in 48 hours.
Source code must be included.
You’re free to use any tools or libraries to create your game. You’re free to start with any base-code you may have. At the end, you will be required to share your source code.

TIP: Compo games are typically reviewed harsher than Jam games. If your game closely resembles a sample game that comes with a development tool, it probably wont get a good score. Be sure to fully customize, and make the game your own.
